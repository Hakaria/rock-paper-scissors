This is my first JavaScript project with the help of The Odin Project!
To use it, load up the html file on any web browser, and a prompt will show up asking to choose rock, paper, or scissors. 
Choose one of those three options and it will go against a randomized selection by the code. Whoever wins is all based on chance!
